		<h2> Why is this site so great? </h2>
			<h3> The Design </h3>
				<p> An everlasting design will whithstand the test of time. </p>

				<p> State-of-the-art technologies including HTML5, and... well, only HTML 5.
			<h3> The Experience </h3>
				<p> Trully, an immersive experience for you and your family! </p>
		<h2> Why should you check the site daily? </h2>
